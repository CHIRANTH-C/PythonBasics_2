Kadane's Algorithm.

Steps :
1. Get the list of number from the inputs in form of csv.
2. Parse it to a list of numbers.
3. Consider two elements , one that stores maximum end of the subarray
    and another one which stores the maximum sum so far.
4. Initialise both of them to 0.
5. Each time we get the positive sum , we compare it with the max sum so far.
6. Update the max sum so far if new sum is greater than max sum so far.

Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence.

Steps :
1. Get two strings , as input from the console
2. Create a two dimentional array in which each cell has length of longest string
3. Itterate over both the strings
4. For each element in 1st string itterate over all the elements in 2nd string
5. If the values in both the strings match save the value in the 2D array
6. If its not match fill rest of the values in the 2 D array by max value in its array

for odd order
matrix = np.zeros((n, n))
Start with a partially filled square with the first number (1) in the center of the first row of the square.
Move diagonally up and to the right to fill in the next number. If a number falls outside of the square, wrap around to the opposite side of the square.
If a cell is already filled, move down one row and fill in the next number in the same column.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all cells are filled.
